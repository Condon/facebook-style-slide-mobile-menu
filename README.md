facebook-style-slide-mobile-menu
================================

How to create a simple Facebook style sidebar menu using only CSS and minimal JavaScript, No need for jQuery Mobile, twitter bootstrap, or anything like that.

This is based on the sliding menu's you see in mobile apps such as Facebook and alike.  I've had a look around and I only really found ones that either move the content to reveal a menu or move the menu in over the content and never one that shifted the content as the menu came in.

This is a pretty basic bit of code but it should do the trick.

Got an improvement or some suggestions, fantastic, just let me know.
